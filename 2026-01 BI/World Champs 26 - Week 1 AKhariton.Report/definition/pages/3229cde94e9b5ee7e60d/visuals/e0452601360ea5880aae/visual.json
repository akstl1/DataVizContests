The city has ranked first in the Housing Affordability Index among surveyed cities throughout the period, reflecting sustained investment in large-scale, affordable, mixed-use residential development. In parallel, Briarport achieved the largest reduction in the Emissions Index of any peer city since 2015. This progress underscores a strong return on investment from optimized infrastructure operations, expanded clean public energy resources, and incentives supporting private-sector adoption of clean energy."
